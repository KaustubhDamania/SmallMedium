## Disclaimer
- This app does not promote piracy or abusing the free limit for starred articles. Do consider buying the Membership if you read a lot.
- All the Medium articles fetched by this app are owned by [Medium Inc.](https://medium.com/)<br>

## Motivation

> For all the avid Medium readers out there like me, who reads starred Medium articles in Incognito mode.

> But copy pasting the URL and viewing it in Incognito mode becomes tedious, so decided to automate it.

> Also wanted to learn Scrapy and Share Target API for PWAs.
